Hi! I'm `Kenneth Calamay`. My friends call me `KL`. I created this simple website so that you, who are in need of web development services can find me, who offers them.

If I didn't know better, I could go on and tell you how my knowledge of Ruby on Rails can help you develop websites fast, or how my developing knowledge in Elixir and Phoenix can help you build future-proof web apps. But I'll take another route instead.

### It's not about what I know, it's about what you want.

You see, you don't need anyone to tell you want technologies they know. You don't even care about those things either. What you do care about is your business. You want to know whether someone can help you create what you want so that you can build it.

But more than that, you need someone who understands that `you're working on limited funds`, and that `you need to ship something fast`. It could be that you want to test how the market responds to your product. It could also be that you want to show your potential investors as soon as possible what you have in hopes of getting more funds to accelerate the development of your ideas.

My two years as an aspiring (although a temporary failure) entrepreneur puts me in a position to understand where you're coming from and where you want to go.

### Here's what we can achieve working together:

With my knowledge of `agile methodology` of developing software, we can create your software in a series of iterations typically lasting 1 to 2 weeks. This means that every two weeks, you have a working software worthy of being released.

With my knowledge of `automated testing`, we can command the computerto always test the whole project so that you don't have to manually test them over and over again (which takes away lots of your high-value time).

With my knowledge of `software architecture`, we can build your project in a way that can be easily modified later. Without this, you are almost guaranteed that you will hear from your developers phrases like "we didn't build the system that way" or "we can't do that without breaking other features."

These sweet spots is what I'd like to collectively call, `the Kenneth Calamay difference`.

So go ahead, contact me and let's talk about your business. 


To your success,

KL

Customer-Centric Web Developer
